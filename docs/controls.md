# Controls

Either mouse button performs the same click on buttons, portraits, the 3D view,
combat rows and dialogs, including title and credits. In text entry, either
button has the same effect at the same position; use Escape to cancel.

At launch, the Darkside intro plays the full story the first time and a shorter
sequence on later launches. Escape ends the story at its input polls; any key
shortens the World-logo boundary holds. Ctrl-Q quits.

At the title, Other Options → C plays the Clouds intro. Escape ends it at
scene polls and returns through the closing parchment to a fresh title, whose
menu waits for a new key. During a parchment transition, any key (including
Escape) completes only that transition. Space and other keys elsewhere do
nothing; mouse clicks do nothing and the pointer is hidden. Other Options → D
clears the remembered seen state and plays the full Darkside intro. Escape ends the story at its polls; in the World
logo, any key only shortens the two boundary holds. The mouse does not skip it.
After a Clouds win, Other Options → V
replays the Clouds ending.

During the Clouds ending, animations ignore Escape, other keys and clicks;
a key during a scroll only shortens it. The two score pages advance on any
key, Escape included, but not on a click. Ctrl-Q quits during the intros and
the ending only.

In the control panel, typing G, O, B, R shows the clock and the play time
until the panel closes; O or B typed out of that order closes the panel,
as in DOS. Any other key the panel does not use, or a click outside its
buttons, also closes it, like Escape.

Exploration completes one Event pass after each input, including unmatched
keys such as period, U, digits, F7 and F8. Insert, Home, End and Page Up/Down
are also unmatched, as are Enter and Backspace in exploration. F8 speech replay
remains omitted.
Closing a dialog completes its opener's pass; responses inside it add none.
Any key or click skips the Inn's closing or opening scroll and the death
scroll.
A 3D-view click runs the manual Event and then the pass, without Space's Wait
unless an Event acknowledgement replaces the current key.

Ctrl translates the plain DOS code before dispatch, overriding Shift:
Ctrl+I is Tab, Ctrl+grave is Space, Ctrl+H is Backspace, Ctrl+M is Enter and
Ctrl+[ is Escape. Ctrl+Up/Down are unmatched keys with a pass. Alt plus a key
acts as the plain key, except Alt+Enter. Keypad translation ignores NumLock;
keypad 0/1/3/7/9 are Insert/End/Page Down/Home/Page Up, and keypad 5 is 5.

F10 makes no pass; Ctrl+F10 is unmatched and does. F11, F12 and Delete
(including keypad decimal) produce no code anywhere. Shift, Ctrl, Alt and
Windows keys alone make no pass. Caps/Num/Scroll Lock produce unmatched
passes; releasing NumLock clears pending keys. Ordinary releases add no pass.
Held keys repeat after 500 ms at the existing nominal 10.9 Hz model; movement
retains the approved buffering that stops after the step in progress on release.

Button and portrait bounds include their left/top edges and exclude right/bottom.
The 3D view accepts x 8..224 and y 8..135. Clicking the panel icon's top rows
(y 137..140) runs the manual Event before opening the panel. Empty panel clicks,
mouse motion, window resize and window close add no pass.

Combat portraits show the remaining members after Run; either button or the
corresponding F key opens that member. The acting member and selected enemy
use the original icons.
