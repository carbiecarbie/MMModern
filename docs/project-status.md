- First public Git repository created
- Milestone 13 is the initial public MMModern codebase

## Architecture notes

MMModern is a standalone application and is not a fork of the complete
ScummVM application.

The current implementation uses selected ScummVM Xeen components and
ScummVM libraries through the compatibility layer under:

`src/compat/scummvm/`

The local development setup currently expects ScummVM source and build
trees outside the MMModern repository.

See `docs/dependencies.md` for additional dependency information.

## Game data

Original Might and Magic / World of Xeen game data is not part of this
repository.

Development and runtime testing require legally obtained original game data.

## Updating this document

Update this file whenever:

- a milestone begins or ends;
- a major subsystem becomes functional;
- test status changes significantly;
- architecture or major dependencies change.

This document should describe the current repository state rather than
future plans or assumptions.
